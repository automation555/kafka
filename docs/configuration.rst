Configuration
=============

.. contents::
    :local:

Kafka uses key-value pairs in the `property file
format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties>`__ for configuration.
These values can be supplied either from a file or programmatically.

.. _brokerconfigs:

------------------
3.1 Broker Configs
------------------

The essential configurations are the following:

-  ``broker.id``
-  ``log.dirs``
-  ``zookeeper.connect``

Topic-level configurations and defaults are discussed in more detail
`below <#topicconfigs>`__.

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../generated/kafka_config.html

More details about broker configuration can be found in the scala class
``kafka.server.KafkaConfig``.

.. _topicconfigs:

-----------------------
3.2 Topic-Level Configs
-----------------------

Configurations pertinent to topics have both a server default as well an
optional per-topic override. If no per-topic configuration is given the
server default is used. The override can be set at topic creation time
by giving one or more ``--config`` options. This example creates a topic
named *my-topic* with a custom max message size and flush rate:

.. code:: bash

      > bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic my-topic --partitions 1
          --replication-factor 1 --config max.message.bytes=64000 --config flush.messages=1


Overrides can also be changed or set later using the alter configs
command. This example updates the max message size for *my-topic*:

.. code:: bash

      > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic
          --alter --add-config max.message.bytes=128000


To check overrides set on the topic you can do

.. code:: bash

      > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic --describe


To remove an override you can do

.. code:: bash

      > bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181  --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic --alter --delete-config max.message.bytes


The following are the topic-level configurations. The server's default
configuration for this property is given under the Server Default
Property heading. A given server default config value only applies to a
topic if it does not have an explicit topic config override.

3.3 Producer Configs
--------------------

Below is the configuration of the Java producer:

For those interested in the legacy Scala producer configs, information
can be found
`here <http://kafka.apache.org/082/documentation.html#producerconfigs>`__.

3.4 Consumer Configs
--------------------

In 0.9.0.0 we introduced the new Java consumer as a replacement for the
older Scala-based simple and high-level consumers. The configs for both
new and old consumers are described below.

.. _newconsumerconfigs:

--------------------------
3.4.1 New Consumer Configs
--------------------------

Below is the configuration for the new consumer:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../generated/consumer_config.html


.. _oldconsumerconfigs:

--------------------------
3.4.2 Old Consumer Configs
--------------------------

The essential old consumer configurations are the following:

-  ``group.id``
-  ``zookeeper.connect``

|                       |                       | can also specify      |
