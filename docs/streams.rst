Kafka Streams
=============

Kafka Streams
-------------

Kafka Streams is a client library for processing and analyzing data
stored in Kafka. It builds upon important stream processing concepts
such as properly distinguishing between event time and processing time,
windowing support, exactly-once processing semantics and simple yet
efficient management of application state.

Kafka Streams has a **low barrier to entry**: You can quickly write and
run a small-scale proof-of-concept on a single machine; and you only
need to run additional instances of your application on multiple
machines to scale up to high-volume production workloads. Kafka Streams
transparently handles the load balancing of multiple instances of the
same application by leveraging Kafka's parallelism model.
